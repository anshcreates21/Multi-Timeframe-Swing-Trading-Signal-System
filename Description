**Project Title:**
Multi-Timeframe Swing Trading Signal System

**Description:**
Developed a Pine Script-based swing trading signal engine designed to optimize entry accuracy through multi-timeframe trend confirmation, RSI filtering, and volume-profile-informed support/resistance mapping. This algorithm identifies high-confidence long/short opportunities by aligning 4H, daily, and weekly EMA trends, verifying RSI thresholds, and detecting price proximity to dynamic high-volume zones.

Key features include:

* Multi-timeframe trend validation (4H/1D/1W EMA crossover)
* Volume-weighted support/resistance detection using rolling arrays
* Signal generation based on RSI divergence from overbought/oversold regions
* Smart daily trade limiter to prevent overtrading
* Integrated alerts and in-chart signal visualization with contextual trend backgrounds

Created as a solo quant research initiative to expand my trading strategy suite within my personal trading business. This tool enhances discretionary swing trading decisions with systematic, statistically-informed entry signals grounded in price structure and volume behavior.
